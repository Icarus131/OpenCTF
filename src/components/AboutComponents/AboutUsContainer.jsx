					Our goal is to make sure good ideas are represented by great collaborations. With the increasing competition in entrance exams, people often end up in universities they initially didn't want to. Regardless of the university, it's always possible that people come up with a unique idea but just can't find people who want to work on it. We move to tackle this issue permanently. All you have to do is worry about the idea. Let us help you find the best possible peer group to work on it ,within your university :)
